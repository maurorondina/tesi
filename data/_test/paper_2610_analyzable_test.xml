   This paper is an investigation of the expressive power of Region-Based Geometry (RBG) (Bennett et al. 2000). This is a qualitative theory of spatial information based on the primitive relation of parthood (P) and a sphere predicate (S). The domain of the theory is that of spatial regions. This theory builds on the earlier work of (Tarski 1929), (Randell, Cui, &amp; Cohn 1992) and (Borgo, Guarino, &amp; Masolo 1996).

  <subsection id="2610.2.2">
   We show that the framework is expressive enough to formulate a ‘qualitative kinematics’ capable of describing the possible movements of systems of rigid objects in a far more general way than previous theories (Davis 1987; Faltings 1987; Davis 1988; Mukerjee &amp; Bhatia 1995). Moreover, our work provides a rigorous formal ontology (as advocated by e.g. (Lenat 1995; Guarino 1998)) for the qualitative description of rigid body motions within constraining environments. Our results go some way towards countering the poverty conjecture of (Forbus, Nielsen, &amp; Faltings 1987; 1991), who claimed that no ‘purely qualitative’ theory could provide an adequate basis for kinematics. However, whether a theory is ‘qualitative’or ‘quantative’ is a rather subtle issue and may not be apparent from its primitive vocabulary. In fact we shall see that within a sufficiently rich theory, based on ostensibly qualitative concepts, coordinate systems and metrical relationships are in fact definable.

   A8) ∀◦ xyz[(x ◦ y ∧ y ◦ z) → x ◦ z] A9) ∀◦ xx yzw[(xy  zw ∧ x  ◦ x) → x y  zw] A1 ensures that every set of regions has a sum. A2 states that every region has a spherical part (from this and A1 it can be proved that every region is equal to the sum of its spherical parts). A3 ensures that for every pair of distinct points x and y there is a sphere centred at one and bounded by the other. A4 says that all spheres can be constructed in this way. Because Nearer is defined in terms of the purely geometrical concepts (B and ◦) and the geometrical axioms are known to be complete relative to the classical interpretation in Cartesian spaces, this means that InI is completely determined for the class of spheres. A5 means that P(x, y) holds just in case every interior point of x is an interior point of y (thus P must be symmetric and transitive). This axiom could be used as a definition so that InI was taken as primitive instead of P. A6 is needed to fully fix the domain of regions by ensuring that they correspond to regular sets of points in the intended Cartesian models. Axioms A8 and A9 ensure that ◦ behaves like equality relative to the geometrical axioms.2 In (Bennett et al. 2000) it is proved that this theory is categorical — all models are isomorphic to standard models defined over classical Cartesian spaces: Theorem: A formula is a consequence of A1–7 (together with the definitional formulae) just in case it is true for any assignment to the variables of regular open subsets of 2 , 1 E.g.

   We now define a number of basic concepts that are very useful for describing spatial situations: D22) C(x, y) ≡def ∃z[S(z) ∧ ∀z [z  ◦ z → (O(z , x) ∧ O(z , y))]] D23) EC(x, y) ≡def C(x, y) ∧ ¬O(x, y) D24) CON(x) ≡def ∀yz[x = y + z → C(y, z)] D25) Comp(c,r) ≡def CON(c) ∧ ¬∃x[CON(x) ∧ P(x, r) ∧ PP(c, x)] C(x, y) is the connection relation and behaves in a similar fashion to the primitive of (Randell, Cui,  Cohn 1992). The definition is based on the observation that for every point of contact (or overlap) between two regions, any sphere centred on that point overlaps both regions. It is easy to prove that C is symmetric and reflexive. EC is the relation of External Connection. CON(x) means that x is self-connected and Comp(c, r) means that c is a maximal self-connected Component of r.

This relation is true of two regions if one can be transformed into the other by the operations of translation, rotation and taking a mirror image. The movement of physical bodies can be described in terms of translations and rotations but they do not ordinarily undergo mirror inversion. Thus, for our kinematic application we employ a congruence relation CG(x, y) which excludes the case where x is a mirror image of y, unless x (and therefore also y) is in itself symmetric. The more general case including mirror transforms we call isometry and write Iso(x, y).3 We first define congruence between spheres and pairs of spheres (SCG). We can then give a definition of isometry (Iso) that makes use of the concept of a ‘scalene sum of spheres’ (SSS) (Borgo, Guarino,  Masolo 1996). This is a region whose Components are spheres and are all of different sizes: D30) SCG(x,y) ≡def S(x) ∧ S(y) ∧ ∃s1s2[s1 ◦ s2 ∧ ET(x,s1) ∧ ET(y, s1) ∧ IT(x, s2) ∧ IT(y, s2)] D31) SCG(x,y; x , y ) ≡def SCG(x, x ) ∧ SCG(y, y ) ∧ ((ET(x, y) ∧ ET(x , y )) ∨ ∃zz [SCG(z,z ) ∧ ED(x, y, z) ∧ ED(x , y , z )] ∨ ∃zz [SCG(z,z )∧IT(z, x)∧IT(z, y)∧IT(z , x )∧IT(z , y )]) D32) SSS(r) ≡def ∀x[Comp(x, r) → (S(x) ∧ ¬∃y[x = y ∧ Comp(y, r) ∧ CG(x,y)])] D33) IsoSSS(x, y) ≡def SSS(x) ∧ SSS(y) ∧ ∀◦ st[(Comp(s, x) ∧ Comp(t, x)) → ∃◦ s t [Comp(s , y) ∧ Comp(t , y) ∧ SCG(s, t; s , t )]] ∧ ∀◦ st[(Comp(s, y) ∧ Comp(t, y)) → ∃◦ s t [Comp(s , x) ∧ Comp(t , x) ∧ SCG(s, t; s , t )]] D34) Iso(x,y) ≡def ∀r[SSS(r) → ((P(r, x) → ∃r [P(r , y) ∧ IsoSSS(r, r )]) ∧ (P(r, y) → ∃r [P(r , x) ∧ IsoSSS(r, r )]))] To distinguish (non-mirrored) congruence from isometry we define a predicate that identifies whether two triangular configurations of spheres are mirror images of one another.

   This will make use of the relation that holds when three spheres are arranged so that their centre points subtend a right angle. We use the following definition (explained by Fig. 2): D39) RECT(a, b, c) ≡def ∃b c dd [b  ◦ b ∧ CG(c , c) ∧ CG(d , d) ∧ ED(c,c , b ) ∧ ED(a, d, c) ∧ ED(a, d , c )] c c’ a b b’ d d’ Figure 2: Rectangular configuration of discs a, b, c Half-Planes Both for expressing qualitative conditions and for interfacing with geometrical representations, the concept of a halfplane is extremely useful. We note that any two externally  tangent discs d1 and d2 define a unique tangent line passing through their point of contact. Moreover, the set of discs containing d1 but discrete from d2 all lie on one side of the tangent whereas those containing d2 but discrete from d1 lie on the other side. These considerations lead to the following definition of a predicate HP(x), which says that the region x is a half-plane: D40) HP(h) ≡def ∀◦ d1d2[(ET(d1, d2) ∧ P(d1, h) ∧ DR(d2, h)) → (∀◦ d3[P(d1, d3) ∧ DR(d2, d3)) → P(d3, h)] ∧ ∀◦ d4[DR(d1, d4) ∧ P(d2, d4)) → DR(d4, h)]) ] d1 d3 d4 h d2 Figure 3: Defining a half-plane in terms of spheres Congruent Pairs It is very useful to be able to specify that a given pair of regions a, b is congruent to another pair a , b . By this we mean that CG(a, a ) and CG(b, b ) and also that the position of a relative to b is the same as the position of a relative to b . If a and b are discrete then this is true just in case CG((a + b), (a + b )); but in general we have to take care of cases where a and b overlap. Thus we define: D41) CG(a, b; c,d) ≡def (CG(a, a ) ∧ CG(b, b ) ∧ CG((a + b), (a + b ))) ∧ (PP(a, b) → ∃xy[Diff(b, a, x) ∧ Diff(b , a y) ∧ CG(x, y)]) ∧ (PP(b, a) → ∃xy[Diff(a, b, x) ∧ Diff(a , b , y) ∧ CG(x, y)]) ∧ (PO(a, b) → ∃xyzw[Diff(a, b, x) ∧ Diff(b, a, y) ∧ Diff(a , b , z) ∧ Diff(b , a , w) ∧ CG(x + y, z + w)]) Disc-Based Coordinate Systems Because Cartesian fields over real numbers provide canonical models for point-based Euclidean geometry, configurations of points and lines are very often described in terms of numerical coordinates. At first sight it may seen that the idea of a coordinate system is alien to region-based geometries. However, as we shall see, something very similar can in fact be set up. Fig. 4 illustrates how three distinguished discs (orig, xunit and yunit) fix a coordinate system. These discs must satisfy the axiom: A10) S(orig) ∧ S(xunit) ∧ S(yunit) ∧ xunit = yunit ∧ IT(xunit, orig) ∧ IT(yunit, orig) ∧ ∃u[CG(u, xunit) ∧ EC(u, xunit) ∧ ID(xunit, u, orig)] ∧ ∃u[CG(u, yunit) ∧ EC(u, yunit) ∧ ID(yunit, u, orig)] The x and y ‘coordinates’ of an arbitrary disc are given by the following defined relation: d dx dy orig yunit xunit x y Figure 4: A disc-based coordinate system: x is a disc with coordinates dx and dy: Coords(x, dx, dy) D42) Coords(d, x, y) ≡def Collin(orig, xunit, x) ∧ RECT(orig, x, d) ∧ Collin(orig, yunit, y) ∧ RECT(orig, y, d) Since we have distinguished discs of ‘unit length’, one could go on to define metrical predicates.

   First we define a linear translation within as a translation from x1 to x2 along some vector such that all translations part way along the vector lie within a confining region y: Figure 7: A problem of constrained movement D48) LTW(x1, x2, y) ≡def ∃d1d2[TAV(x1, x2, d1, d2) ∧ ∀x[PTAV(x1, x,d1, d2) → P(x,y)]] We define a ‘short’ (less than 180◦ ) rotation of a region between two orientations x1 and x2, such that during the rotation the region remains within some hosting environment y as follows: D49) SRotW(x1, x2, y) ≡def ∃s[∃x [RotOrd(x1, x , x2, s)] ∧ ∀x [RotOrd(x1, x , x2, s) → P(x , y)] An arbitrary rotation within is just defined as the concatenation of two short rotations: D50) RotW(x1, x2, y) ≡def ∃x [SRotW(x1, x , y) ∧ SRotW(x , x2, y)] Simple move within: D51) SMW(x1, x2, y) ≡def (LTW(x1, x2, y) ∨ RotW(x1, x2, y)) We now axiomatise a predicate MoveWithin(x1, x2, y) to say that a rigid body can move from region x1 to region x2, while remaining within region y: A11) MoveWithin(x1, x2, y) ↔ SMW(x1, x2, y) ∨ ∃x [SMW(x1, x , y) ∧ MoveWithin(x , x2, y)] We could restrict this so that a move was a strictly alternating sequence of LTW and RotW operations, which reduces the search space (though it is still infinite).

  <subsection id="2610.6.5">
   MoveWithin as a Finite Sequence of SMWs In fact, although axiom A11 is correct it is not strictly adequate since it does not actually force MoveWithin to coincide with the transitive closure of SMW. However it is likely to be sufficient for a large class of constructive proofs of whether MoveWithin(x1, x2, y) follows from (or is consistent with) some given constraints.
  </subsection>
  <subsection id="2610.6.6">
   To get a more complete charaterisation of MoveWithin we would first have to define the notion of a finite sequence.
  </subsection>
  <subsection id="2610.6.7">
   Within our framework this can be modelled by (e.g.) a region σ that is a sum of discrete spheres, such that there is a smallest sphere s1 and a largest sphere sn and for all other spheres there is a sphere of half the diameter and a sphere of twice the diameter (thus the spherical Components are striclty ordered). We can then define MoveWithin(a, b, r) by saying that for each sphere s where Comp(s, σ) there is a pair of regions xs, ys related by SMW(xs, ys, r), such that xs1 = a and ysn = b and moreover if t is a component of σ with twice the diameter of s then ys = xt. Given such a definition A11 would not be needed.
  </subsection>
  <subsection id="2610.6.8">
   General Continuous Motions The definition of MoveWithin also assumes that any motion could be reduced to a series of linear translations and rotations. We call such a motion a TR-motion. However, in general there are many continuous motions that cannot be reduced in this way. For instance an object might trace a parabolic curve. On the other hand, it is clear that if an object moves within a confining environment such that it always has more than one degree of freedom, then for every continuous motion there is a TR-motion with the same start and end locations. Hence we believe that for most robotic applications only TR-motions need to be considered.
  </subsection>
  <subsection id="2610.6.9">
   Nevertheless, for the sake of having a Comprehensive ontology one might want to define arbitrary continuous motions. In fact we have been able to define set-theoretically the notion of a set of unit discs whose centre points form a continuous non-fractal path; and by using CG(x, y; z, w) one can easily construct from this a definition of a set of regions lying on a continuous (non-fractal) path. But such a definition is of only theoretical importance and will not be given here.

 <paragraph id="2610.7" name="Movable Obstacles" label="Problem">
  <subsection id="2610.7.1">
   So far we have considered the case of a single rigid object moving in a constraining environment; but in general a situation will involve multiple movable objects.
  </subsection>
  <subsection id="2610.7.2">
   We need a way of representing a collection of rigid bodies in terms of a fixed finite number of regions. This would enable the situation to be included in the argument places or ordinary predicates. A naı̈ve representation would be to sum the bodies and then identify objects with Components of this sum. But, if bodies may be EC to each other this does not work. However, we can appeal to the famous four colour theorem to see that any configuration of 2-dimensional objects can be described in terms of the Components of four regions.
  </subsection>
  <subsection id="2610.7.3">
   Thus, we represent a situation by a 4-tuple σ = r1, r2, r3, r4 of mutually DR regions. The following definitions enable us to describe the movement of one amongst a collection of movable objects: D52) Sit(r1, r2, r3, r4) ≡def DR(r1, r2) ∧ DR(r1, r3) ∧ DR(r1, r4) ∧ DR(r2, r3) ∧ DR(r2, r4) ∧ DR(r3, r4) D53) SitComp(c, s1, s2, s3, s4) ≡def Comp(c, s1) ∨ Comp(c,s2) ∨ Comp(c, s3) ∨ Comp(c, s4) D54) SitEQ(σ, σ ) ≡def Sit(σ) ∧ Sit(σ ) ∧ ∀x[SitComp(x,σ) ↔ SitComp(x, σ )] D55) MoveOne(σ, σ , f) ≡def ∃r1r2r3r4oo f [Diff(f, r1 + r2 + r3 + r4, f ) ∧ MoveWithin(o, o , f ) ∧ SitEQ(σ, r1 + o, r2r3r4) ∧ (SitEQ(σ , r1 + o , r2, r3, r4) ∨ SitEQ(σ , r1, r2 + o , r3, r4)) MoveOne(σ, σ , f) holds just in case: σ and σ are situation tuples representing configurations of objects; f is the region of free space in which the objects are situated; and, σ can be transformed into σ by moving just one of the objects.
  </subsection>
  <subsection id="2610.7.4">
   The definition requires some explanation: r1, r2, r3, r4 represents the situation of all the objects except the one that is moved; without loss of generality we can assume that the initial situation σ can be obtained by adding the starting location o of the moved object; the final situation is obtained by adding a congruent region o to either r1 or r2 corresponding to cases where a ‘four-colouring’ of the configuration would have the start and finish locations coloured the same or differently.
  </subsection>
  <subsection id="2610.7.5">
   To determine whether one situation can be transformed into another by a series of movements of movable objects we can axiomatise a general MoveTrans relation as follows.5 A12) MoveTrans(σ, σ , f) ↔ (MoveOne(σ, σ , f) ∨ ∃σ [MoveOne(σ, σ , f) ∧ MoveTrans(σ , σ , f)]) Pushing Obstacles In order to model the action of an auto-motive object such as a robot pushing a movable obstacle we have to know something about the resistance of obstacles to forces. Since we assume that we know which obstacles can and cannot be moved we are not concerned with the magnitude of an obstacle’s resistance but only its direction of action. Thus, we model a movable obstacle by a pair r, c, where r is the region it occupies and c is its centre of resistance. If a force acts on an obstacle through its centre of resistance it will move in a straight line; if it acts otherwise the force will cause a rotation.

   D56) Push(r, r , x, c, x c ) ≡def ∃d1d2[EC(d1, d2) ∧ P(d1, r) ∧ P(d2, x) ∧ Aligned(d1, d2; c, c )] ∧ CG(r, x; r , x ) ∧ CG(x, c;x , c ) v1 d1 d2 r c v2 r’ x x’ c’ Figure 8: Robot r pushes an object from x to x It is fairly straightforward to modify the definitions of MoveOne and MoveTrans in order to describe situation transforms that can be achieved by a series of push operations. However, space does not permit us to give full details here.

  <subsection id="2610.8.1">
   We have explored the use of an expressive region-based geometry for describing spatial situations and reasoning about the movements of rigid bodies. Our formalism provides a rigorous ontological foundation for use in AI systems that need to process spatial information.
  </subsection>
  <subsection id="2610.8.2">
   For most practical applications one will require tractable sublanguages of our very expressive formalism. (Cristani, 5 This suffers from the same limitations as axiom A11 for MoveWithin given above, and has the same possible solution.
  </subsection>
  <subsection id="2610.8.3">
   Cohn,  Bennett 2000) investigate the Complexity of reasoning with a combination of mereological and morphological relations and proves tractability of a significant constraint language, which is a fragment of our formalism. Recursive definitions such as that for MoveWithin could be implemented by search algorithms. We envisage architectures whereby search is combined with one or more constraint solvers which determine when branches can be closed. Inductive theorem proving techniques may also be useful.
  </subsection>
  <subsection id="2610.8.4">
   We believe that the formalism of region-based geometry will be extremely useful as a framework within which more Computationally oriented representations can be embedded.
