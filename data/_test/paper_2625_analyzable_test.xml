   We study a fundamental planning problem, localization, to investigate whether gridworlds make good testbeds for planning with incomplete information. We find empirically that greedy planning methods that interleave planning and plan execution can localize robots very quickly on random gridworlds or mazes. Thus, they may not provide adequately challenging testbeds. On the other hand, we show that finding localization plans that are within a log factor of optimal is NP-hard.

   Testbeds (prototypical test domains) are planning domains that allow researchers to evaluate their planning methods, communicate performance results of their methods to others, interpret published performance results of others more easily, and compare their methods against these performance results (Hanks, Pollack,  Cohen 1993). Testbeds should be easy to describe, but they should also provide a wide enough variety to mimic real domains. In particular, testbeds must include cases that are not too easy to solve because otherwise planning methods would appear to be more efficient than they actually are in some of the domains of interest. Consequently, planning researchers have studied in detail the properties of their testbeds for planning with complete information, such as blocksworlds and sliding tile puzzles. Examples of such experimental and theoretical studies include (Gupta  Nau 1992; Reinefeld 1993; Slaney  Thiébaux 1996; Koenig  Simmons 1996).

   In recent years, planning researchers have become interested in planning with incomplete information. This is an important research direction because, in the real world, complete information is often not available. Gridworlds appear to be by far the most frequently used testbeds for this work. However, not much is known about their properties.

   We study localization tasks, which are fundamental planning tasks for robots. We find experimentally that greedy planning methods that interleave planning and plan execution can localize robots very quickly on gridworlds with random obstacles or random mazes. Thus, random gridworlds or mazes may not provide adequately challenging cases to push the state of the art. Although the theoretical planning community has shown the complexity of planning tasks with incomplete information to be difficult in general (Littman 1994; Madani, Hanks,  Condon 1999), the reported success of current greedy methods on some gridworlds (Nourbakhsh 1997; Koenig  Simmons 1998a) and our experiments on random gridworlds and mazes reported here suggest that the constrained topology of gridworlds may make them easy to solve. However, we analyze the performance of one greedy planning method in detail, namely the Delayed Planning Architecture (Genesereth  Nourbakhsh 1993), and show that there exist gridworlds on which its performance is poor. Furthermore, we prove that localization even with only suboptimal worst-case performance is NP-hard.

   Thus there are instances of gridworlds on which all greedy planning methods perform very poorly, and we show how they can be constructed. In general, our results improve the understanding of previously used planning methods and testbeds for planning with incomplete information and help empirical researchers to select appropriate planning methods as well as testbeds to demonstrate them.

   We study planning with incomplete information in gridworlds of the kind shown in Figure 1. Gridworlds are finite rectangular areas of square cells. Each cell can be either traversable or untraversable. A robot is always in exactly one cell. It starts in a traversable cell and can then always move north, east, south, or west. Gridworlds have been used as testbeds for different planning methods. Planning tasks with a known start cell and deterministic movement have often been modeled as traditional graph search problems. Planning tasks with nondeterministic movement and automatic sensing that determines the current cell uniquely have been modeled as totally observable Markov decision process models (Dean et al. 1993).

   We study localization tasks in gridworlds. Localization is a prototypical planning task with incomplete information.

  <subsection id="2625.4.2">
   The robot knows a map of the gridworld but does not know its start cell. Evidently, the robot may need to localize prior to performing many other tasks. The sensors on-board the robot tell it in every cell whether the cells immediately adjacent to it in the four compass directions (north, east, south, west) are traversable. (The border of the gridworld is untraversable and observed as such.) The robot can then move one cell to the north, east, south, or west, unless that cell is outside of the gridworld or untraversable (in which case the robot remains in its current cell). We assume that there is no uncertainty in actuation and sensing and that the robot always knows its orientation from the on-board compass.
  </subsection>
  <subsection id="2625.4.3">
   These assumptions are simplifying but sufficiently close to reality to enable one to use the resulting planning methods on real robots (Nourbakhsh 1996).

  <subsection id="2625.4.4">
   The robot is localized if it knows its current cell. A deterministic (randomized) localization plan specifies (a probability distribution for) the movement to execute based on all previous movements and observations. A localization plan is valid iff, no matter which cell the robot is started in, it eventually prints out its current cell or correctly determines that localization is impossible. The objective of planning then is to determine a valid deterministic or randomized localization plan that minimizes the expected number of movements for the worst possible start cell (the “worst-case expected performance”), in the followingsense: We first calculate the expected number of movements for each possible start cell. The expectation is only important for probabilistic plans and is taken with respect to the randomization of the probabilistic plans. The worst-case expected performance is then the maximum of these values.

   The gridworld planning tasks can be modeled as tree search tasks. The states of the tree search tasks are sets of cells, corresponding to cells that the robot could be in. For example, if the robot has no knowledge of its start cell for the gridworld A1 E3 C5 B1 D5 F3 D6 B2 B1 D5 C1 E5 A1 E3 C5 A1 E3 C5 A1 E3 C5 A1 C5 N untraversable W S E untraversable traversable untraversable N traversable W S E traversable untraversable traversable N untraversable W S E untraversable traversable untraversable N traversable W S E untraversable traversable traversable N untraversable W S E untraversable traversable untraversable N untraversable W S E untraversable traversable untraversable N untraversable W S E traversable traversable untraversable N untraversable W S E traversable traversable traversable N traversable W S E untraversable traversable traversable N traversable W S E untraversable traversable traversable move N move W move S move E move N move W move S move E AND node OR node Figure 2: AND-OR Search Tree planning task from Figure 1 but observes untraversable cells in all compass directions except to its south, then the start state of the robot contains three possible start cells: A1, E3, and C5. In each state, the robot can choose a movement (“OR” nodes of the search tree) and, if it does not stop, then makes a new observation (“AND” nodes of the search tree).
  </subsection>
  <subsection id="2625.5.2">
   For example, Figure 2 shows the beginning of a search tree for the gridworld planning task. (The dashed part of the tree is unnecessary and could be deleted.) A deterministic localization plan assigns each OR node a movement (“deterministic OR node”). Similarly, a randomized localization plan assigns each OR node a probability distribution over the movements (“randomized OR node”). The following theorem shows that valid randomized localization plans cannot perform better than valid deterministic localization plans.

   Theorem 1 No valid randomized localization plan has a better worst-case expected performance than a valid deterministic localization plan with optimal worst-case performance.

   This theorem implies that there is no point in having robots flip coins (that is, move nondeterministically) to localize them in gridworlds with optimal worst-case (expected) performance. In the following, we therefore consider only deterministic localization plans. The tree search tasks in this case are AND-OR search tasks and valid localization plans are decision trees.

   Nourbakhsh and Genesereth noticed experimentally that using a complete AND-OR search to find valid localization plans with optimal worst-case performance for gridworld planning tasks was completely infeasible but that planning methods that interleave planning and plan execution could efficiently find valid localization plans with good worstcase performance for their gridworlds (Genesereth  Nourbakhsh 1993; Nourbakhsh 1997).

The robot executes the subplan and then repeats the process until it is localized or detects that localization is impossible. Subsequently, Koenig and Simmons developed a generalization of the Delayed Planning Architecture (Koenig  Simmons 1998a). The Delayed Planning Architecture has been applied to a variety of planning problems with incomplete information, including the Bay Area Transit Problem (Hsu 1990) and the Tool Box Problem (Olawsky, Krebsbach,  Gini 1993). In the context of gridworlds, it has been demonstrated experimentally by their authors on real robots and in simulation.

  <subsection id="2625.6.2">
   We re-implemented the Delayed Planning Architecture and performed experiments in gridworlds with random obstacles, averaged over 1000 runs with randomly selected start cells. The results in Table 1 show that current planning methods perform very well on random gridworlds. No matter what the size or obstacle density of the gridworld is, the robot can gain information with only slightly more than one move on average, and localizes in a small number of total moves. Table 2 shows that similar results also hold for random acyclic mazes that were generated by depth-first search (using code provided by Joseph Pemberton). Therefore, we need new gridworlds to push the state of the art.

   Proof Sketch: We construct a gridworld on which the Delayed Planning Architecture has the worst-case performance ratio claimed in the theorem. The gridworld contains many copies of rectangular “blocks” of size  "!$#%'(! . Along the south side of each block is a wall of length ) and immediately to the north of the wall is an east-west corridor of length '  . There are  north-south corridors *,+ .-/*,+ 0 of length  each, separated by walls, that branch off of the east-west corridor to the north, starting in the sixth column of the block. To their immediate left is a winding corridor that goes up  cells, goes left two cells, and then goes down 213 cells. Figure 3 (left) shows an example. The gridworld consists of a column of '4 blocks, from block 5  on top to block 5 076 at the bottom. In the extreme west, we add a full length north-south hallway, which makes the gridworld connected. Figure 3 (right) shows an example. We make the last cell of north-south corridor *,+ 08,9 of block 5 0:6 8,9 untraversable, for all ;4=?@1(A . We also make the last = cells of the winding corridor of block 5 076 8B9 untraversable, for all ;2C=DE?)A . This completes the description of how the gridworld is constructed.

   The robot can find the beginning of some winding corridor from any starting point with at most LM% movements and then move at most :N1OA into the winding corridor, counting its length, which identifies the block and thus localizes the robot. Thus, the worst-case number of movements in an optimal plan is at most G@EAPFQK$,! . Now we show that the Delayed Planning Architecture performs many more than K$,! movements if the robot starts at the east end of the east-west corridor of block 5  (in the figure: marked X). When the robot is started, it knows where it is with the exception of which block it is in. The robot makes R12A movements into north-south corridor *,+ 0 because this is the fastest way of reducing the number of possible robot cells. At this point the robot can eliminate block 5S0:6 . The robot then returns to the eastwest corridor and makes  1A movements into north-south corridor *T+ 08  , at which point it can eliminate block 5 0:6  , and so on. Finally, it makes  1A movements into the winding corridor, at which point it can eliminate block 5 and has localized. The robot has made a total number of movements equal to  UD1@AVF)K$ ! .

   The Delayed Planning Architecture can be applied to finding homing sequences or adaptive homing sequences for deterministic finite state automata whose states are colored, a concept from theoretical computer science. A homing sequence is a linear plan (movement sequence) with the property that the state colors observed during its execution uniquely determine the resulting state (Kohavi 1978), and it is known that finding a shortest homing sequence is NP-hard in general (Schapire 1992). It could be the case that the constrained topology of gridworlds makes them easy to solve and thus that valid localization plans with optimal worstcase performance for the gridworld planning tasks can be found in polynomial time. We prove, however, that finding valid localization plans even with suboptimal worst-case performance in gridworlds is NP-hard and thus that there are instances of gridworlds on which the Delayed Planning Architecture does not perform well. The following theorem shows that it is easy to find valid localization plans in gridworlds.

   Proof Sketch: For Part 1, first determine the connected components prq of the given map of the gridworld. Second, acquire a map p_s of the gridworld component where the robot is, by moving the robot in a depth-first search manner. Third, determine which of the prq are identical to map p s , by depth-first search of every map, starting from the west-most cell of the north-most traversable cells. If exactly one p q matches p s , the robot has been localized. If more than one prq matches p s then the robot cannot localize. This algorithm is correct, needs time t$Xu'vT] , and executes t$XuUv,] movements. For Part 2, construct a gridworld consisting of two spirals as shown in Figure 4. The gridworld is connected.

  <subsection id="2625.7.4">
   If the start cell is at the end of one of the spirals (in the figure: X), then any valid localization plan has to execute WDXuUv,] movements (in the figure: move to cell Z) before it can distinguish which spiral it is in.

Third, simulate a fictitious robot that executes the localization plan on the map of the gridworld from each possible start cell, verifying that the number of movements is smaller than the given value, and that the localization plan yields a correct answer, when it is possible to localize.
  </subsection>
  <subsection id="2625.7.8">
   Therefore, a decision tree can be guessed and verified in polynomial time, provided that the decision tree has polynomial size. We now ensure this provision to complete the proof. The algorithm needs to guess only decision trees that have as many leaf nodes as there are possible start cells, that is, no more than uUv . This is so because there is at most one branch from the root to a leaf for each start cell. Since there are at most uUv leaves, there are at most uUvyx4z AND nodes with two or more children. The algorithm needs to guess only decision trees that have, on any branch, at most u'vUx%z AND nodes with only one child between two AND nodes with two or more children. If there were more, then a belief state would repeat on that branch and the part of the branch between two repeating belief states (including one of them) could be cut out. Thus, the decision tree has t$Xu?ZHvBZ7] AND nodes and thus t$Xu Z v Z ] nodes, which is at most quadratic in the size of the problem description.

   Thus, the number of movements is no larger than the length of an east-west hallway. Now assume that the robot starts at the east end of east-west hallway ew£ . Thus, it cannot visit a different eastwest hallway and, as part of the localization, must determine that no north-south corridor in a block is shorter than ­ . If the robot moves into a north-south corridor less than ­.Õ Õ « , it cannot detect whether the corridor is shorter than ­ because all north-south corridors are at least ­$Õ long. Thus, consider all north-south corridors that the robot moves into at least ­$Õ Õ « . The collection of subsets that these corridors correspond to must be a set cover, for otherwise the robot could not distinguish between the east-west hallways ew£ and ew° for the elements ± ° not covered by the collection of subsets. Let ­Ö denote the cardinality of this set cover. To determine how close to minimum the set cover is, we determine a lower bound on the total number of movements of the robot.

   To summarize, Theorem 3 shows that is easy to find valid plans in gridworlds, while Theorems 4 and 5 together show that it is NP-hard to find valid localization plans with optimal or even near-optimal worst-case performance. Combining Theorems 4 and 5 also tells us that the problem stated in Theorem 4 is NP-complete.

   As part of the theoretical results in the previous two sections we constructed hard instances of gridworlds on which greedy planning methods, such as the Delayed Planning Architecture, do not perform well. These gridworlds can be used in test suites in addition to random gridworlds or mazes. Table 3 contains the results of the same experiments that Table 1 reported on, except that we now use the Delayed Planning Architecture in conjunction with the gridworlds that we constructed as part of the proof of Theorem 2 instead of random gridworlds. (The numbers in parentheses refer to the particularly bad case used in the proof, where the robot starts at the east end of the east-west corridor of the top-most block.) Clearly, the robot now needs to execute a larger number of movements to reduce the number of possible cells than in random gridworlds or mazes, and the total number of movements is larger than for random gridworlds or mazes of comparable sizes and obstacle densities as well.

   While testbeds for planning with complete information have been studied extensively, this paper provides a first study of testbeds for planning with incomplete information. We studied localization tasks in gridworlds. Previous experimental work had shown that greedy planning methods, such as the Delayed Planning Architecture (Genesereth  Nourbakhsh 1993; Nourbakhsh 1997), can efficiently find valid localization plans with good performance in random gridworlds and mazes. Our theoretical analysis showed that it is easy to find valid localization plans in arbitrary gridworlds but, perhaps surprisingly, NP-hard to find valid localization plans even with only suboptimal worst-case performance in some gridworlds, even if the gridworlds are connected. This suggests that gridworlds are appropriate testbeds for planning with incomplete information. As part of our proofs, we also showed how to construct hard instances of gridworlds on which the Delayed Planning Architecture and all other greedy planning methods do not perform well at all. These gridworlds can be used in addition to random gridworlds and mazes. In the future, we intend to apply similar ideas to localization tasks where the robots use partially observable Markov decision process models (Koenig  Simmons 1998b).
